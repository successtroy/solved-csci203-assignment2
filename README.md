<h1>Problem</h1>

You are required to construct a program that will perform the following sequence of operations:

<ul>

 <li>Reads a string and an integer, N, where the value of N is no larger than the number of characters in the string. (You may assume that the characters in the string are not repeated)</li>

 <li>Generate and output all possible N-character permutations of the characters in the string.</li>

 <li></li>

</ul>

<table>

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="84"></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td></td>

   <td></td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>

<ul>

 <li>Store the generated permutations, as they are calculated, in a 2-4 tree. Print the inorder traversal of the tree.</li>

</ul>

E.g.

Input  AbdDC 2

Output

Ab, Ad, AD, AC, bA, bd, bD, bC, dA, db, dD, dC, DA, Db, Dd, DC, CA, Cb, Cd, CD
